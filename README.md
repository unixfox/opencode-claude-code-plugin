An [opencode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that wraps the **Claude Code CLI** (`claude`) and routes model traffic through it instead of the Anthropic HTTP API. You get to use opencode's UI, agents, MCP, and permission system while authenticating and billing through whichever method `claude` is logged into (Pro/Max plan, Bedrock, Vertex, or API key).

> Maintained fork of [`unixfox/opencode-claude-code-plugin`](https://github.com/unixfox/opencode-claude-code-plugin). Published as `@khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin` on npm.

---

## TL;DR

```bash
# 1. Make sure `claude` is installed and logged in
claude --version

# 2. Add this to your opencode.json
```

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin"]
}
```

That's it. Restart opencode, pick a `claude-code` model, done.

The plugin self-registers the `claude-code` provider, all current Claude Code models (Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5/4.6/5, Opus 4.5/4.6/4.7/4.8/5, Fable 5/5.1, Mythos 5/5.1) with reasoning variants (`low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`), and sensible defaults for tool proxying. You don't need to write a `provider` block at all unless you want to override something.

## Models

The plugin auto-registers the following. They appear in the model picker without any extra config.

| ID | Display name | Context | Output | Reasoning variants | Price × |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | Claude Haiku 4.5 | 200k | 64,000 | – | 1× |
| `claude-sonnet-4-5` | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 200k | 64,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 3× |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 3× |
| `claude-sonnet-5` | Claude Sonnet 5 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 3× |
| `claude-opus-4-5` | Claude Opus 4.5 | 200k | 64,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 5× |
| `claude-opus-4-6` | Claude Opus 4.6 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 5× |
| `claude-opus-4-7` | Claude Opus 4.7 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 5× |
| `claude-opus-4-8` | Claude Opus 4.8 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 5× |
| `claude-opus-4-8-fast` | Claude Opus 4.8 Fast | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 10× |
| `claude-opus-5` | Claude Opus 5 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 5× |
| `claude-opus-5-fast` | Claude Opus 5 Fast | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 10× |
| `claude-fable-5` | Claude Fable 5 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 10× |
| `claude-fable-5-1` | Claude Fable 5.1 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 10× |
| `claude-mythos-5` | Claude Mythos 5 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 10× |
| `claude-mythos-5-1` | Claude Mythos 5.1 | 1M | 128,000 | low/medium/high/xhigh/max | 10× |

`claude-mythos-5` and `claude-mythos-5-1` are Mythos-class counterparts to the corresponding Fable models, but without safety classifiers, and are **limited availability via [Project Glasswing](https://anthropic.com/glasswing)**. They're registered unconditionally; if your Claude account lacks access, `claude --model` just errors. Use the corresponding generally available `claude-fable-5` or `claude-fable-5-1` otherwise.

Capabilities for every model: text + image input, text output, tool use, attachments. No temperature control, no PDF/audio/video, no interleaved streaming.

**Price ×** is each model's per-token list price relative to Haiku, the cheapest model. It's derived exactly from Anthropic's published pricing (input and output ratios both come out the same: Haiku $1/$5 = 1×, Sonnet $3/$15 = 3×, Opus $5/$25 = 5×, Fable/Mythos 5 and 5.1 / Opus fast mode $10/$50 = 10×). So **Fable/Mythos 5 and 5.1, and fast-mode Opus, all cost 2× standard Opus 5**. The same multiplier is shown as a `(N×)` suffix on the display name in opencode's model picker, since opencode has no dedicated multiplier field. On a flat Max/Pro subscription it doubles as a rough guide to how fast each model drains your usage limit.

Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1 keep the same $10/M input and $50/M output rates as 5.0, but cache reads cost $0.25/M instead of $1/M. Their cache-write rate remains $12.50/M.

The model ID is passed straight through to `claude --model`, so anything Claude Code accepts works. The two `-fast` IDs are the one exception, described below.

### Fast mode

`claude-opus-5-fast` and `claude-opus-4-8-fast` run the same models at up to 2.5× the output tokens per second, at 2× the price ($10/M input, $50/M output, the 10× column). Pick them in the model selector like any other model.

The `-fast` suffix is this plugin's own marker, not a model name Anthropic serves. The plugin strips it and spawns `claude --model claude-opus-5 --settings '{"fastMode":true}'`, because that settings layer is the only way to opt a headless (`--print`) session into fast mode: there is no `--fast` flag, and the old `claude-opus-4-6-fast` style model names are retired. Requires Claude Code 2.1.220+; below that the plugin skips the opt-in and you get standard speed.

Fast mode is not available everywhere, and it **fails soft**: an ineligible account drops back to standard speed with no error. Known blockers:

- **Usage credits are off.** The most common one. Run `/usage-credits` in an interactive `claude` session to enable them.
- **Not first-party.** Fast mode is Anthropic-API-only; Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry are excluded.
- **Free tier**, or an organization that has turned fast mode off.
- **Cooldown.** Fast mode has its own rate limit; after a hit, Claude Code falls back to standard until it clears.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FAST_MODE=1` in the environment turns it off outright.

Because a downgrade is otherwise invisible, and because the picker shows these IDs at 10× regardless, the plugin logs a **warning** (once per reason) when a fast turn actually ran at standard speed, naming the reason. If you see it, switch to the non-fast ID so the picker's price matches your bill.

### Picking a variant

Variants set the underlying reasoning effort. They're regular opencode model variants — pick them in the model selector. If you'd previously declared variants in your project's `opencode.json`, they're merged on top of the defaults so nothing gets lost.

## Configuration

The minimum config is just the `plugin` entry above. Everything below is optional override that goes in a `provider.claude-code` block.

### Multiple Claude Code accounts

Declare account names once and the plugin expands them into separate opencode providers:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin"],
  "provider": {
    "claude-code": {
      "options": {
        "accounts": ["personal", "work"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`default` is always implicit, so the config above creates:

| Provider ID | Display name | Claude config dir |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-code-default` | `Claude Code (Default)` | normal `~/.claude` |
| `claude-code-personal` | `Claude Code (Personal)` | `~/.claude-personal` |
| `claude-code-work` | `Claude Code (Work)` | `~/.claude-work` |

Non-default accounts use `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` through a generated wrapper script, so auth/session state stays isolated per account. Shared capability files and folders are symlinked from `~/.claude` into each account dir when present:

```text
CLAUDE.md
settings.json
skills/
agents/
commands/
plugins/
```

Identity/session state is not shared.

Login each account once:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-personal" claude auth login
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-work" claude auth login
```

The account model IDs are internally suffixed, for example `claude-sonnet-4-6@work`, so long-lived Claude subprocess sessions do not collide across accounts. The generated wrapper strips the suffix before calling `claude --model`.

### Subagents: your account, their model

opencode's agent config cannot express "inherit the account, choose the model". A subagent that omits `model` inherits the invoking agent's whole model string; one that pins `model` inherits neither half, so pinning Opus also pins whichever account was written into it. This plugin closes that gap, because it is the piece that knows the account is the *provider* while the model is only a `--model` flag.

Write an agent markdown file. Nothing goes in `opencode.json`.

```markdown
---
description: Designs and builds UI work
mode: subagent
---
You are a designer...
```

`@designer` now runs on **the account of the session that invoked it**, on whatever model you point it at. Which model comes from one of two places.

Per agent, in the agent's own file:

```yaml
forceModel: claude-haiku-4-5
```

Or once, for every subagent that pins nothing, in the provider options:

```json
{ "provider": { "claude-code": { "options": { "defaultSubagentModel": "claude-opus-5" } } } }
```

The rules, in order:

| The agent | Runs on |
| --- | --- |
| `forceModel: <id>` | the caller's account, that model |
| `mode: subagent`, no model, `defaultSubagentModel` set | the caller's account, that model |
| `mode: subagent`, no model, no default set | untouched, inherits the caller's model |
| `model: <provider>/<id>` | exactly that, account and all (untouched) |
| anything opencode ships (`explore`, `general`, `compaction`) | untouched |

**`defaultSubagentModel` is unset by default and nothing is overridden without it.** That is deliberate: this feature rewrites what the model picker said would run, so an existing setup that upgrades the plugin has to behave exactly as it did before. Built-ins are excluded for the same reason, since forcing Opus onto a cheap exploration agent would be an expensive surprise nobody asked for. An unknown model id is refused and the original kept, rather than spawning the CLI with a `--model` it will reject.

Two things worth knowing. The overridden model is part of the Claude session key, so a subagent forced to Opus never shares a `claude` process with a Fable parent in the same directory. And opencode still prices the turn against the model *it* routed, so a cost readout attributes the work to the caller's model, not the one that actually ran.

### The effort an agent runs at

The same file can state its own thinking budget:

```yaml
reasoningEffort: high
```

That beats whatever effort the call arrived with. It has to, because opencode resolves one effort for a session and a subagent inherits it, which is wrong in the expensive direction: a caller who picked `max` for their own turn otherwise hands `max` to every worker it dispatches, and a mechanical lane burns a weekly cap at the costliest setting available. Model and effort together are what a turn costs, so both belong with the agent rather than with whoever happened to dispatch it.

An agent that declares nothing keeps the inherited effort, so this changes nothing until a file asks for it. An unrecognised level is refused and the inherited one kept, since the CLI rejects a level it does not know. Compaction is exempt: its summary always gets the full budget.

To force an **account** rather than a model, pin the full string. Both halves are needed, because the provider selects the account's config dir and the `@account` marker is what the model was registered under for that provider:

```yaml
model: claude-code-appical/claude-opus-5@appical
```

### Options reference

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin"],
  "provider": {
    "claude-code": {
      "options": {
        "cliPath": "claude",
        "proxyTools": ["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "WebFetch", "Task"],
        "skipPermissions": true,
        "permissionMode": "default",
        "bridgeOpencodeMcp": true,
        "strictMcpConfig": false,
        "idleProcessTimeoutMs": 900000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cliPath` | string | `process.env.CLAUDE_CLI_PATH ?? "claude"` | Path to the `claude` binary. |
| `accounts` | string[] | – | Optional account list. `default` is implicit. Expands into `Claude Code (Default)`, `Claude Code (Personal)`, etc. |
| `cwd` | string | session directory, then `process.cwd()` | Working directory for the spawned CLI. Resolved **lazily per request**: an explicit value wins, then the opencode session's own `directory` (so `opencode serve` and the web UI spawn in the right project even though one server handles many), then `process.cwd()`. Contributed by [@galvani](https://github.com/galvani). |
| `skipPermissions` | boolean | `true` | Pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to `claude`. Ignored when `proxyTools` is set — the proxy handles permissions through opencode instead. |
| `permissionMode` | `acceptEdits` \| `auto` \| `bypassPermissions` \| `default` \| `dontAsk` \| `plan` | – | Forwarded to `claude --permission-mode`. |
| `proxyTools` | string[] | `["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "WebFetch", "Task"]` | Claude built-in tools to route through opencode's executor + permission UI. Opt-in extras: `"Question"`, `"Compress"`. See [Selective tool proxy](#selective-tool-proxy). |
| `extraDisallowedTools` | string[] | – | Extra Claude built-ins to switch off with `--disallowedTools`, on top of what `proxyTools` implies. Claude's names, e.g. `["NotebookEdit"]`. See [Closing a tool with no proxy](#closing-a-tool-with-no-proxy). |
| `proxyToolTimeoutMs` | `Record<string, number>` | – | Per-tool proxy call deadline in ms, keyed by proxy tool name (`bash`, `task`, …). Defaults: 10 min flat, `task` → 60 min. For `bash`, the call's own `input.timeout` is honoured on top (`max(resolved, input.timeout)`). See [Selective tool proxy](#selective-tool-proxy). |
| `planModeQuestion` | boolean | `false` | Route `ExitPlanMode` approval through opencode's native `question` tool instead of a text "(yes/no)" prompt. Opt-in; verify the form works in your installation first. See [Plan mode](#plan-mode). |
| `controlRequestBehavior` | `allow` \| `deny` | `allow` | Default response when `skipPermissions: false` and Claude sends a `can_use_tool` control request. |
| `controlRequestToolBehaviors` | `Record<string, "allow" \| "deny">` | – | Per-tool override for `can_use_tool`. Example: `{ "Bash": "deny", "Read": "allow" }`. |
| `controlRequestDenyMessage` | string | built-in message | Message returned to Claude on a deny. |
| `bridgeOpencodeMcp` | boolean | `true` | Auto-translate your opencode `mcp` block into Claude's `--mcp-config`. See [MCP bridge](#mcp-bridge). |
| `mcpConfig` | string \| string[] | – | Extra `--mcp-config` paths/JSON passed alongside the bridged config. |
| `strictMcpConfig` | boolean | `false` | Pass `--strict-mcp-config` so Claude loads **only** the configured servers and ignores `~/.claude/settings.json`. |
| `webSearch` | `"claude"` \| `"disabled"` \| `<tool>` | `"claude"` | Routing for Claude's built-in `WebSearch`. See [WebSearch routing](#websearch-routing). |
| `multiStepContinuation` | boolean | `true` | Append a system-prompt hint nudging Claude to chain tool calls within one turn instead of pausing between subtasks. Each opencode turn boundary requires the user to manually press "continue", so for multi-step tasks this reduces friction. Set `false` to disable. |
| `autoContinueIncompleteTurns` | boolean \| `"smart"` | `"smart"` | Smartly continue incomplete Claude CLI results inside the same opencode turn. Reduces manual "continue" presses when Claude ends after reasoning/tool activity without a useful final answer. Set `false` to disable. |
| `compactionModel` | string | `"claude-haiku-4-5"` | Model used when opencode invokes `/compact`. Override per-process via the `CLAUDE_CODE_COMPACTION_MODEL` env var (env wins over config). See [Compaction](#compaction). |
| `ignoreAnthropicApiKey` | boolean | `false` | Strip `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` from every spawned `claude` process so it authenticates with your logged-in subscription instead of pay-as-you-go API billing. The plugin warns once at startup whenever an API key is detected, regardless of this setting. See [Billing](#billing-change-june-15-2026-agent-sdk-credit). |
| `idleProcessTimeoutMs` | number | – | Kill a retained headless Claude worker after this many idle milliseconds following a completed turn. The session id is preserved for `--resume`; a new turn cancels the timer. Values above Node's maximum timer delay (`2147483647`) are ignored. Omit or set to `0` to retain workers until LRU eviction. Interactive transport is excluded. Contributed by [@bernardofortes](https://github.com/bernardofortes). |
| `bridgeOpencodeSkills` | boolean | `false` | Expose your opencode skills to Claude's native `Skill` tool. See [Skill bridge](#skill-bridge). Written by [@broskees](https://github.com/broskees). |
| `interactive` | boolean | `false` | **Experimental.** Drive the interactive `claude` TUI (subscription billing) instead of headless `--print`. Requires opencode running under Bun with PTY support; silently falls back to headless otherwise. Env: `CLAUDE_CODE_INTERACTIVE_TRANSPORT=1`. See [Interactive transport](#interactive-transport-experimental). |
| `interactiveBypass` | boolean | `false` | Deprecated/no-op with `interactive`: Claude Code's TUI shows a manual safety confirmation for `bypassPermissions`, so the plugin intentionally does not pass it. |
| `interactiveAllowTools` | string[] | `["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "Read", "WebFetch"]` | With `interactive`: built-in tools pre-allowed without prompting (replaces the default list). MCP server wildcards (`mcp__<server>__*`) are always added from the bridged config. |
| `interactiveSystemPrompt` | boolean | `true` | With `interactive`: append this plugin's CLI/AGENTS/continuation prompt via `--append-system-prompt-file`. The transport intentionally does not forward opencode's own system prompt, because it can trigger Claude Code's third-party-app usage gate on subscription accounts. Set `false` only for diagnostics. |

### Overriding model metadata

To rename a model, change a limit, or add a custom one:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin"],
  "provider": {
    "claude-code": {
      "models": {
        "claude-sonnet-4-6": {
          "name": "Sonnet (custom)",
          "limit": { "context": 1000000, "output": 32768 }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Anything you supply is merged on top of the defaults; you don't need to redeclare every model.

---

## Interactive transport (experimental)

By default the plugin spawns `claude --print` (headless). From **June 15, 2026** that usage bills against the separate [Agent SDK credit](#billing-change-june-15-2026-agent-sdk-credit) on subscription plans. The interactive transport instead drives the real interactive `claude` TUI — which bills as **normal plan usage** — under a native PTY inside opencode's Bun runtime, types your prompt into it, and streams the session transcript (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`) back through the same pipeline the headless transport uses.

```json
"options": { "interactive": true }
```

Or per-process: `CLAUDE_CODE_INTERACTIVE_TRANSPORT=1`.

### Requirements

- opencode must be running under **Bun** with `Bun.Terminal` (PTY) support. If it isn't, the flag is ignored and the headless transport is used — nothing breaks.
- A logged-in `claude` (subscription auth). The whole point is plan billing, so API-key auth gains nothing here.

### What carries over from the headless transport

- The plugin's appended prompt (Claude CLI context, AGENTS.md guidance, continuation rules). The interactive transport intentionally does not forward opencode's own system prompt, because live testing showed that payload can trigger Claude Code's third-party-app usage gate on subscription accounts.
- The MCP bridge: bridged servers are passed via `--mcp-config` + `--strict-mcp-config`, and every bridged server is pre-allowed as `mcp__<server>__*`.
- Model selection, session reuse, and the whole streaming/usage pipeline.

Set `interactiveSystemPrompt: false` only for diagnostics. While disabled, the interactive session will not receive the plugin's CLI context, AGENTS.md guidance, or continuation hints.

### What's different

- **Permissions:** the interactive TUI has no `can_use_tool` control channel, so tools can't be approved per-call through opencode. Built-in tools are pre-allowed via a settings allow list (default `Bash, Edit, Write, Read, WebFetch`; override with `interactiveAllowTools`). `bypassPermissions` is intentionally not used here because Claude Code shows a manual safety confirmation in the TUI and defaults to exit.
- **Input is text-only:** images and other non-text blocks are dropped (with a logged warning); tool results are rendered as labeled text.
- **Output granularity:** text arrives per transcript record, not token-by-token, so it can feel chunkier than headless streaming.
- **Turn timeout:** a turn that produces no terminal stop within 30 minutes is reported honestly as an error result (visible truncation), not silently ended.
- `/compact` always uses the headless transport regardless of this setting.

---

## Selective tool proxy

This is the core feature.

By default, the plugin proxies `Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`, `WebFetch`, and `Task`. It disables Claude's corresponding built-in tool and exposes an equivalent through an in-process MCP server. Claude calls the MCP version, which blocks until opencode runs the tool through its own executor and permission system.

### Default proxied tools

| `proxyTools` value | Claude built-ins disabled | Proxy MCP tool exposed |
|---|---|---|
| `"Bash"` | `Bash` | `mcp__opencode_proxy__bash` |
| `"Edit"` | `Edit`, `MultiEdit` | `mcp__opencode_proxy__edit` |
| `"Write"` | `Write` | `mcp__opencode_proxy__write` |
| `"WebFetch"` | `WebFetch` | `mcp__opencode_proxy__webfetch` |
| `"Task"` | `Agent` | `mcp__opencode_proxy__task`, `mcp__opencode_proxy__task_batch` |
| `"Question"` | `AskUserQuestion` | `mcp__opencode_proxy__question` |
| `"Compress"` | none | `mcp__opencode_proxy__compress` |

### OpenCode-native subagents

`Task` is proxied by default. The proxy disables Claude CLI's `Agent` tool and emits an unexecuted `task` call; it does not register a replacement task tool. OpenCode's built-in TaskTool remains responsible for permission checks, creating or resuming the child session, selecting the configured subagent, and foreground/background lifecycle.

- **Permissions:** the calling agent's `permission.task` rule applies to the target `subagent_type`. Grant `task: "allow"` on agents that should delegate without a prompt; an `ask` or `deny` rule remains authoritative. The plugin never bypasses this decision.
- **Resume:** pass the child session ID back as `task_id` to continue that subagent session. Omit it to create a fresh child.
- **Nested tasks:** current opencode defaults `subagent_depth` to `1`, so a first-level child cannot launch another child. Increase top-level `subagent_depth` to permit deeper nesting, and explicitly grant `permission.task` on every subagent that should delegate; opencode otherwise adds a task deny to spawned subagent sessions.
- **Background:** `background: true` returns after starting the child and lets opencode notify the parent when it finishes. Current opencode requires `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true` in the environment of the opencode process. Foreground is the default.
- **Several at once:** `mcp__opencode_proxy__task_batch` takes a `tasks` array of ordinary task inputs and runs them concurrently. It exists because Claude Code sends MCP requests one at a time: when the model emits two `task` calls in one response, the second only leaves the CLI after the first has returned (measured live, 2026-09-06), so "launch two subagents" was always serial. The plugin turns one `task_batch` call into N opencode `task` calls inside a single tool boundary, which opencode executes in parallel, then hands the model every result together, labelled in task order. Same permissions, same 60-minute deadline, same `subagent_type` list. Enabled whenever `Task` is proxied. Designed and first implemented by [@broskees](https://github.com/broskees) on his fork.

**Steering models to it.** Headless Claude Code CLIs expose no `Agent`/`Task`
dispatch tool of their own (verified on 2.1.211), while they *do* expose
`TaskCreate` — a todo tool. So "use a subagent" requests get mis-resolved:
a todo appears, nothing runs, and the model may still narrate a successful
dispatch. Two spawn-time countermeasures prevent that. The plugin injects
opencode's live agent-type list into the `task` proxy description (so the model
picks a real `subagent_type` instead of guessing a Claude Code name like
`general-purpose`, and doesn't grep configs to check a subagent exists), and
appends a system-prompt note naming
`mcp__opencode_proxy__task` as the only dispatch path — with the ToolSearch
recovery step for harnesses that defer MCP tool schemas. Both apply per Claude
process at spawn, and provider options are read once at opencode startup, so
`proxyTools` changes need a full opencode restart.

### Proxy endpoint security

The proxy is a small HTTP MCP server on an ephemeral loopback port, and calling it runs Bash, Edit and Write through opencode's executor. Since 0.13.2 it requires a 256-bit bearer token, generated per server and handed to Claude in the `headers` block of the `0600` MCP config file the plugin writes. Requests are also rejected unless the `Host` header matches the bound `127.0.0.1:<port>` authority, no `Origin` header is present, and the content type is `application/json`.

**Upgrade if you are on 0.13.1 or earlier.** Before this, any local process could post to that port and execute commands as you, and a web page you visited could do the same blind, without reading the response. Reported by @willmcginnis in [#28](https://github.com/khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin/pull/28); tracked as [GHSA-3mxm-w7gf-3c5x](https://github.com/khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin/security/advisories/GHSA-3mxm-w7gf-3c5x) (High, CVSS 7.5). No exploitation is known: it was found by code audit, not an incident.

**Restart every opencode you have running.** A plugin is read once, when the process starts, so an opencode you left open keeps the old code and keeps serving an unauthenticated proxy port for as long as it lives, however new the installed version is. Long-lived sessions are the ones to check:

```sh
lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep opencode
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST http://127.0.0.1:PORT/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}'
```

A patched process answers `401`. A `200` is a pre-0.13.2 process still running, and restarting it is the fix.

Nothing to configure. If proxied tools ever stop working after a Claude Code upgrade, check the plugin log for `proxy-mcp rejected a request`, which names which guard failed.

### Closing a tool with no proxy

`proxyTools` only reaches built-ins the plugin can replace. A built-in with no opencode equivalent, `NotebookEdit` today and whatever Claude Code ships next, stays enabled and unmediated no matter what you put in that list. `extraDisallowedTools` names them directly:

```json
"options": {
  "extraDisallowedTools": ["NotebookEdit"]
}
```

These go straight to `claude --disallowedTools`, so use Claude's tool names rather than opencode's. There is no replacement: the capability goes away rather than being routed through opencode, which is the point, but the model then has to work without it.

Unknown entries in `proxyTools` are logged as a warning at spawn rather than passing silently, so a typo shows up as "ignoring unknown proxyTools entries" in the plugin log instead of quietly leaving the matching built-in unmediated.

### Context compression

`"Compress"` is off by default. Add it when you run a harness that expects the model to manage its own context (opencode-dcp injects exactly those instructions), and the plugin exposes `mcp__opencode_proxy__compress`:

```json
"options": {
  "proxyTools": ["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "WebFetch", "Task", "Compress"]
}
```

It is the one proxy tool opencode never sees. The call is answered inside the plugin: the model passes a `summary`, the plugin stores it, and the turn continues normally. At the start of the **next** turn the Claude Code session is discarded and a fresh `claude` starts with that summary prepended to its system prompt, and nothing else. The earlier conversation is not replayed, so a thin summary means real lost context. The reset waits if the incoming turn is carrying tool results for the running process.

Without it, the appended system prompt tells the model that `compress` is unavailable and to ignore instructions that ask for it, which is the right answer when nothing implements it.

Only those seven values are actually proxied; anything else you put in `proxyTools` is ignored. Proxying `Edit` also disables `MultiEdit` — opencode has no batched-edit equivalent, so Claude is forced to fan out into single `Edit` calls that each flow through the permission UI. The `"Question"` proxy is version-gated on opencode's built-in `question` tool: on builds that lack the registry entry the def is silently dropped (a forwarded call would otherwise render as `⚙ invalid`), so add it only on opencode versions that ship the `question` tool.

Without `"Task"` in `proxyTools`, Claude's built-in `Agent` tool stays enabled and Claude orchestrates subagents internally with no opencode child-session visibility. To opt out of all proxying, including Task, use an explicit empty list:

```json
"options": { "proxyTools": [] }
```

### Subagent todos

When Claude works through a multi-step task it emits `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` calls. The plugin translates those into opencode's full-list `todowrite` so the todo panel populates. Inside a **subagent** that translation is blocked unless you say otherwise: opencode's task tool injects `todowrite: false` into the tools dict for any subagent without an explicit rule, so the plugin's synthetic emissions surface as `⚙ invalid todowrite` rows instead of todos. The built-in `general` subagent denies it by default.

Grant it per subagent definition in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "multistep": {
      "description": "Multi-step worker whose progress should be visible as todos",
      "mode": "subagent",
      "model": "claude-code-default/claude-opus-5",
      "permission": {
        "todowrite": "allow",
        "todoread": "allow",
        "task": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes on that example:

- `todowrite: "allow"` is the load-bearing line. Without it you get `⚙ invalid` rows, not a broken run.
- `todoread` is worth allowing too so the subagent can re-read its own list across turns.
- `task: "deny"` is explicit rather than implied. Leave it denied unless this subagent should itself delegate, in which case set `"allow"` and raise the top-level `subagent_depth` (opencode defaults it to `1`, so a child cannot spawn a grandchild).
- Provider and agent config are read at startup, so restart opencode fully after editing.

The todos render in the **subagent's own session view**, not the parent's panel. Navigate to it in the TUI with `session.child.next` (and back with `session.parent`); run `opencode --print-logs` or check the keybindings if those actions are unbound in your setup.

To confirm the data actually landed rather than trusting the UI:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db \
  "select id, parent_id from session order by rowid desc limit 5;"
# then, with the child session id:
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db \
  "select tool, state from part where session_id='<child-id>' and tool='todowrite';"
```

### What you get with proxying on

- opencode's **permission prompts** for every Bash/Edit/Write/WebFetch call (the default `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` is NOT applied to proxied tools).
- opencode's **audit log** captures the calls.
- Per-tool **policy rules** in opencode apply.

### What you give up

- A small per-call latency hop through `127.0.0.1:<random>/mcp`.
- Batched-edit ergonomics: with `Edit` proxied, Claude can no longer use `MultiEdit`, so a refactor that would have been one tool call becomes N single `Edit` calls.

### Per-tool proxy timeouts

Every proxied tool call has a deadline: if opencode hasn't resolved it (run the underlying tool and returned a result) within that many milliseconds, the call is rejected and Claude receives a timeout error. Deadlines are resolved per tool, most-specific layer winning:

1. flat default — 10 min (matches Claude CLI's own Bash ceiling)
2. per-tool default — **`task`: 60 min**, **`question`: 30 min**, everything else: 10 min
3. your `proxyToolTimeoutMs` override (case-insensitive key)
4. for `bash` only, the call's own `input.timeout` — the proxy never undercuts a build the caller explicitly asked to run long (`max(resolved, input.timeout)`)

The `task` and `question` defaults are deliberately generous. Subagents routinely run 20–40 min, and a question can sit on a slow operator; under the old flat 10-minute ceiling the proxy fired mid-call, Claude believed its dispatch had failed, and the subagent's eventual result was dropped (the parent turn had already ended on the timeout error). If a `task` call *does* time out, the error tells Claude not to "schedule a wake-up" — that is a Claude Code affordance which cannot fire in this headless/proxy context, so deferring silently loses the work.

Starting with 0.15.0, clients advertising SSE receive immediate headers and keepalive comments every 15 seconds while a proxy call runs. This prevents long unanswered HTTP requests from being abandoned before the configured tool deadline; JSON-only clients retain their existing response format. Keepalives do not extend the tool deadline.

If Claude nevertheless abandons the HTTP call, the plugin preserves narration emitted while opencode was running the tool, renders it on return, and delivers the late completion as a plain-text continuation naming the original call. It tells Claude not to run the tool again. A silent post-tool continuation gets one resumed-process retry, preserving the original model, account, effort, and proxy configuration; a second failure ends with an error rather than an indefinite hang. Buffered narration is capped at 500 lines and 2 MiB, with a warning if output was dropped.

```json
"options": {
  "proxyTools": ["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "WebFetch", "Task"],
  "proxyToolTimeoutMs": { "Task": 5400000, "bash": 1800000 }
}
```

## Side questions with /btw

After a normal Claude Code turn, at any time, including while Claude is still working:

```text
/btw Why did you choose that approach?
```

The plugin registers the command without replacing an existing user-defined `btw` command. The question goes to Claude Code's native `side_question` control protocol on the conversation's live process, using the same model, account, and context. Claude Code answers it on a separate call, concurrently with whatever the main turn is doing. Claude never sees the aside afterwards: the question never enters Claude Code's own transcript, and the plugin keeps every `/btw` exchange out of the prompt it sends the model.

Where the answer appears, in the conversation either way:

- **A receipt, straight away**, when you asked while a turn was running, in the reply you are watching, so a `/btw` typed mid-turn is visibly taken rather than looking swallowed until the answer arrives:

  ```text
  ▌ **btw:** <your question, in full>
  ▌ *sent to Claude on the side*
  ```

  It quotes the question back untruncated because the prompt box clears on submit and no `/btw` message is ever created, so this is the only place you can read back what you sent. If opencode is between two streams at that moment (it was running a tool), the receipt lands when the next one opens.
- **Inside the running turn's own reply**, as soon as the answer arrives, when you asked while Claude was working. It is written into the reply you are already watching as its own block, headed `▌ **btw:** <your question>`, so it stays there and is easy to pick out. Every line of the aside, answer included, carries that `▌` bar, so it reads as one block down its whole height. Nothing is queued and the `/btw` message itself is dropped, because the answer is already in the transcript. The turn goes on to deliver its own reply as usual.
- **As its own `/btw` message and answer** when the conversation is idle, or when the turn had no stream open to write into at that moment (opencode was running a tool between two of them). In the second case the pair lands when the turn ends; nothing is announced in the meantime, because the answer itself is what arrives.
- Follow-ups work: earlier asides in the conversation are sent along as the aside's history.

Notes:

- Requires Claude Code CLI **2.1.258 or newer**, the oldest verified version.
- Requires a live **headless** process for the conversation. Send a normal message with a Claude Code model first if the process has not started or was evicted; the answer in the transcript tells you when that is the case. Interactive transport is not supported.
- Asking immediately after starting a turn is fine. The conversation's process only exists once that turn reaches the model, so `/btw` waits for it (up to 30 seconds) instead of falling back to being queued. If no Claude Code process turns up in that window, because the running turn belongs to another provider, the question is answered when the turn ends.
- One aside per conversation at a time. A second `/btw` while one is in flight is asked once the turn ends.
- An aside costs nothing in opencode's counters: a `/btw` pair reports 0 tokens and $0, and a block written into a running turn adds nothing to that turn's usage. The control response has no usage fields, so aside usage is not counted anywhere; this does not mean the request is free.
- An aside written into a turn is marked, and the plugin strips it again if the conversation ever has to be replayed into a fresh Claude Code process. It was never Claude's own output.
- A request times out after two minutes. Abort and timeout cancel that side request without killing the main session. If the running turn is still not over after 30 minutes, the plugin gives up on that `/btw`; ask again once the turn ends.
- The answer is never delivered as a notification: it always lands in the conversation, where it stays. The only two toasts left are the cases where nothing reaches the conversation at all, a bare `/btw` (which shows the usage text) and a turn that ran past the 30 minute wait.

Fully restart opencode after upgrading to load the command and runtime changes. Other providers do not gain Claude's native side-question behavior from this command.

## Configuration skill

The package includes a `claude-code-plugin` skill so your agent can configure it without asking you to navigate all its options. Ask, for example:

```text
Use the claude-code-plugin skill to configure a work account and idle worker cleanup.
```

It covers accounts, models and agent effort, proxy tools, permissions, MCP/skill bridging, timeouts, logging, upgrades and troubleshooting. It directs the agent to preserve JSONC comments, change only requested settings, validate the result, protect credentials and ask before paid probes or broader permissions.

The plugin registers the bundled directory with opencode's `skills.paths`, making it available to other providers too on supporting opencode versions. For ordinary headless Claude turns it also loads through Claude's native Skill tool as `opencode-skills:claude-code-plugin`, even when `bridgeOpencodeSkills` is off. This requires CLI `--plugin-dir` support; interactive transport, compaction and direct `doGenerate` calls do not load the native bridge.

No separate skill installation or copying is needed. It ships with each package version, so upgrading updates the reference. Fully restart opencode to load it. `test-configure-skill.ts` checks coverage of provider/logging options, model ids, proxy tools and environment variables; maintainers must update behavior and default guidance in the same change as the implementation.

## Skill bridge

opencode and Claude Code use the same on-disk skill format, a `<name>/SKILL.md` whose frontmatter carries `name` and `description`, but they read from different directories. opencode looks in `.opencode/skills/` and `~/.config/opencode/skills/`; the Claude CLI looks in `~/.claude/skills/` and its own plugins. So opencode advertises your skills in the system prompt it forwards, the model calls `Skill("browser-automation")`, and Claude answers `Unknown skill`.

With `bridgeOpencodeSkills: true` the plugin discovers your opencode skills, stages a throwaway Claude Code plugin directory that links them, and passes it as `claude --plugin-dir`. They register natively, prefixed with the plugin name:

```text
opencode-skills:browser-automation
opencode-skills:rtk
```

Claude can invoke them with the Skill tool or as `/opencode-skills:<name>`. `--plugin-dir` is scoped to the spawned session, so nothing is written into your `~/.claude`.

Discovery order, first match wins: `.opencode/skills/` walking up from the working directory, then `~/.opencode/skills/`, then `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/`, then `~/.config/opencode/skills/`. A project skill shadows a global one of the same name. If the skill set is unchanged the staged directory is reused between spawns.

Bridging **your own skills is off by default** here, unlike on the fork it came from: every bridged skill is also listed in the system prompt opencode already forwards, so a large skill set is paid for twice on every turn. Turn it on when you see `Unknown skill`. The bundled configuration skill is loaded independently of this opt-in. The native bridge is not used for compaction or interactive transport, or on a Claude CLI without `--plugin-dir` (the plugin probes `claude --help` and logs a notice).

This bridge was written by [@broskees](https://github.com/broskees) (Joseph Roberts) on his fork and absorbed here with credit; see [Credits](#credits).

## WebSearch routing

Claude Code ships a built-in `WebSearch` tool. The `webSearch` option controls who actually executes those calls:

| `webSearch` value | Behavior | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `"claude"` (default) | Claude CLI runs WebSearch internally via Anthropic. Zero setup, no extra cost, no API key. The query is shown in the transcript as a `> Web search:` line (opencode has no `WebSearch` tool registry entry, so a raw tool row would render as `⚙ invalid`). | Most users. |
| `"<opencode-tool-name>"` (e.g. `"websearch_web_search_exa"`) | Forward to that opencode-side tool with `executed:false`. Requires the corresponding MCP server to be configured in opencode (e.g. [exa-mcp-server](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server)). | You want a specific search backend (Exa, Tavily, Brave) and have the MCP wired up in opencode. |
| `"disabled"` | `WebSearch` is added to `--disallowedTools` so the model can't call it. | Compliance/security scenarios where outbound search isn't allowed. |

```json
"options": { "webSearch": "websearch_web_search_exa" }
```

**Trade-offs**

- Claude-side execution: free with your Claude usage, no API key, but no opencode visibility into queries/results, no caching/rate-limit hooks.
- opencode-side execution: choose any backend, queries flow through opencode's audit/policy/cache, but costs money (search APIs are paid) and adds a network hop.
- Some Claude-specific tool features stay on the built-in side (notably `MultiEdit` — see the note above).

---

## MCP bridge

If `bridgeOpencodeMcp` is true (the default), the plugin reads your opencode config's `mcp` block, translates it into Claude's MCP schema, writes it to a temp file, and passes that to `claude --mcp-config`. So whatever MCP servers you've already configured in opencode become available to Claude with no extra setup.

### Discovery order (highest to lowest priority)

1. `OPENCODE_CONFIG` env var (file path)
2. `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` env var
3. Walk up from the current `cwd` looking for `opencode.jsonc`, `opencode.json`, `config.json`, or a `.opencode/` directory
4. Global `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode` or `~/.config/opencode`

Later sources override earlier ones **by server name**, so a project-level MCP server replaces a global one with the same id.

### Translation

| opencode `type` | Claude `type` |
|---|---|
| `local` | `stdio` |
| `remote` | `http` |

If you want to manage MCP servers only via `~/.claude/settings.json`, set `bridgeOpencodeMcp: false`.

To replace (rather than augment) bridged MCP with your own:

```json
"options": {
  "bridgeOpencodeMcp": false,
  "mcpConfig": "/path/to/your/mcp.json",
  "strictMcpConfig": true
}
```

---

## Sessions

Each chat keeps a long-lived `claude` subprocess so the model retains its native context across turns.

- **Session key**: `(cwd, model, tool-scope, opencode-session-id)`. The opencode session id comes from the `x-session-affinity` header opencode sets on third-party provider calls. Two chats in the same project on the same model run in **separate** CLI processes — they don't race. In account mode, model IDs are suffixed per account, so account sessions do not collide.
- **Same chat, multiple turns** → process reused, full Claude context retained.
- **New chat** → fresh process under the new session key.
- **Resumed chat after restart** → in-memory state is gone; a new process spawns and the conversation history is summarized and prepended.
- **Abort (Esc / Ctrl+C)** → the plugin sends the Claude CLI a stream-json `interrupt` control request, so the CLI actually stops generating and running tools instead of finishing the abandoned turn on your bill. The process stays alive for the next message in that chat. If a turn is somehow still running when the next one starts, it is interrupted first (5 s cap). Contributed by [@broskees](https://github.com/broskees).
- **Idle timeout** → when `idleProcessTimeoutMs` is configured, a completed headless turn arms an eviction timer; reuse cancels it, and eviction preserves the session id for `--resume`.
- **Cap**: 16 active processes, LRU eviction.

---

## Plan mode

Set `permissionMode: "plan"` to forward `--permission-mode plan` to Claude. The plugin handles `ExitPlanMode` specially — instead of forwarding it as a tool call, it converts it to a confirmation prompt that flows through opencode normally.

> **Plan mode never permits edits, and you do not have to configure anything for that.** The CLI lets `--dangerously-skip-permissions` override `--permission-mode plan` outright, and `skipPermissions` defaults to `true`, so until this was fixed anyone asking for plan mode silently got full write access (measured on CLI 2.1.258: the run wrote a file on request without a prompt). The plugin now drops the skip flag whenever `permissionMode` is `"plan"`; every other mode governs prompting, which is what that flag is for, so those still pass it.
>
> Two things to know. Nothing releases plan mode mid-session: headless Claude Code is not offered an `ExitPlanMode` tool, so approving a plan in chat does not unlock writes, and leaving plan mode means changing the config and restarting opencode. The plugin warns about this once at startup. And the CLI still writes its own plan document under `~/.claude*/plans/`, which is its own feature and outside your workspace; your files and commands are untouched.

By default that prompt is text: the plan is rendered as markdown, followed by `**Do you want to proceed with this plan?** (yes/no)`, and you answer in your next message.

### Approval as a real form (`planModeQuestion`, opt-in)

Set `planModeQuestion: true` to route the approval through opencode's native `question` tool instead:

```json
"options": {
  "permissionMode": "plan",
  "planModeQuestion": true
}
```

The plan is still rendered, but the turn then ends on `tool-calls` and opencode runs its own `question` tool, so approval is a form rather than prose. Your answer is fed back to the CLI as the `tool_result` for the original `ExitPlanMode` call, which is what actually unlocks plan mode on the Claude side. A "yes" typed as ordinary text never does that. Anything other than picking `yes` (including custom text) comes back as rejection feedback the model is told to act on.

> **This cannot currently fire on the default headless transport, so leaving it off costs you nothing.** The form it delivers through works (see [AskUserQuestion](#askuserquestion)), but headless `--print` does not offer the model an `ExitPlanMode` tool at all on CLI 2.1.258, and the bridge keys on that tool call. Measured three ways: asked directly for its tool list in plan mode, the CLI returned `Agent, Bash, Edit, ListAgents, Read, ReportFindings, ScheduleWakeup, Skill, ToolSearch, Workflow, Write` and nothing else; asked to do work it said "I'm unable to exit plan mode from within the tool set available to me"; and a full probe through this plugin with `planModeQuestion: true` produced no `ExitPlanMode` anywhere in `plugin.log` while the model asked for approval in prose. The name is still known to the CLI (`--disallowedTools ExitPlanMode` validates silently, where a bogus name warns), so this reads as headless dormancy rather than removal, the same shape as the [`AskUserQuestion` fallback](#askuserquestion). The text path below is what you actually get, and it works. Re-run those probes on a newer CLI before assuming the bridge is reachable. On opencode builds with no `question` registry entry the plugin silently keeps the text path (look for `plan-mode question gate` in the log).

## AskUserQuestion

opencode ships a built-in `question` tool (`packages/opencode/src/tool/question.ts`) that renders a real TUI form with options and a custom-answer field — near-identical to Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` (`multiSelect` → `multiple`). The plugin can route `AskUserQuestion` through it so the prompt becomes an actual form instead of plain text. Two modes:

### With `"Question"` in `proxyTools` (opt-in)

> **Correction, September 6, 2026: this is no longer blocked, and earlier releases of this README were wrong about why.** The missing form was attributed to an upstream TUI regression. The real cause was local: a notification plugin awaited macOS `alerter` dismissal inside `tool.execute.before`, so the question tool never started. Native providers load that same global plugin, which is why their identical failure did not isolate the TUI. With the hook made non-blocking, the form renders, and the full path through this plugin is verified: on plugin 0.18.0 / Claude Code 2.1.258 / opencode 1.18.29, Claude called `mcp__opencode_proxy__question`, the request appeared in `GET /question`, the reply completed the tool, and Claude's answer contained a token it could only have read from the tool result. Confirmed in a real terminal too: with `"Question"` enabled and opencode relaunched, the proxied call rendered as a TUI form and the clicked answers came back into the turn.
>
> `"Question"` is still opt-in, because turning it on disables Claude's own `AskUserQuestion` (see the fallback below) and that trade should be deliberate. If your form does not render, see [question troubleshooting](#question-troubleshooting) before assuming an upstream bug.

#### Question troubleshooting

For a stalled call, inspect `GET /question` on the same opencode server and workspace. If no request exists, check awaited `tool.execute.before` hooks and custom tools replacing `question`, especially notification plugins: a hook opencode waits on runs *before* the tool, so the request cannot exist yet. If a request exists but no form appears, check session ownership, pending permissions, and event delivery. The separate detach/reattach issue [anomalyco/opencode#36604](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/36604) remains open; [PR #36603](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/36603) is closed without merging. Do not infer a universal platform or version failure from either symptom.

Add `"Question"` to `proxyTools`. Claude's built-in `AskUserQuestion` is disabled via `--disallowedTools`, and the plugin exposes `mcp__opencode_proxy__question` in its place. A primary agent needs no permission entry (verified on opencode 1.18.29 with no `permission` block at all); if a subagent's form is refused, grant it `permission.question: "allow"` on that agent, the same way [subagent todos](#subagent-todos) need `todowrite`. The model calls the proxy, opencode renders the form, and the operator's answers come back as arrays of selected labels. On builds that lack the `question` registry entry the def is silently dropped at spawn (version gate), and the deny/markdown fallback below applies instead.

`proxyTools` replaces the default list rather than adding to it, so repeat the defaults you still want:

```json
"options": {
  "proxyTools": ["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "WebFetch", "Task", "Question"]
}
```

To turn it back off, drop `"Question"` from the list. It is **not** in the default list, so no configuration means the deny/markdown fallback below stays in force.

The same spawn-time caveat as `"Task"` applies: provider options are read once at opencode startup, so restart opencode fully after adding it. Question calls get a 30-minute proxy deadline (raise it with `proxyToolTimeoutMs` if you expect to be AFK longer; an expired call comes back as an error, not an answer).

### Without the proxy (default fallback)

When `"Question"` is not in `proxyTools` (or the opencode version lacks the `question` tool), the plugin handles `AskUserQuestion` as follows:

1. **It renders the full question.** The tool's payload — every question, header, option label, and option description — is emitted as readable markdown into the assistant stream so the user actually sees the choices (same approach as `ExitPlanMode`).
2. **It is never auto-allowed at the CLI gate.** Allowing it would let the headless Claude CLI resolve its own question (no TTY → fabricated/empty answer) and proceed on a guess. `controlRequestBehaviorForTool` hard-denies `AskUserQuestion` and returns a message telling the model to **stop and wait for the operator's answer** — end the turn, call no further tools, and never self-answer. (Before v0.7.0 this message also offered an "if the run is non-interactive, proceed with a reasonable guess" fallback. The model could not reliably tell interactive opencode from a headless run and routinely took it, so questions appeared to be skipped — [issue #8](https://github.com/khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin/issues/8). For genuinely unattended runs, use the `controlRequestToolBehaviors` override below instead.)

This hard-deny sits **below** `controlRequestToolBehaviors` in precedence but **above** the global `controlRequestBehavior`. So:

- The global `controlRequestBehavior: "allow"` does **not** override it (interactive setups stay correct by default).
- An explicit per-tool entry **does**. For a fully unattended/automated deployment that prefers "guess and continue" over "stop and wait", restore the old auto-allow:

  ```json
  "provider": {
    "claude-code": {
      "options": {
        "controlRequestToolBehaviors": { "AskUserQuestion": "allow" }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  With `"allow"`, the Claude CLI answers its own `AskUserQuestion` internally and the run never blocks — appropriate only when no operator is watching and forward progress matters more than a correct decision.

---

## Compaction

When you run `/compact` in opencode, the plugin handles it on a short-lived dedicated Claude CLI spawn instead of routing it through your main conversation process. Three reasons:

1. **Cost.** The summarizer reads your entire transcript every time. Routing through a smaller model keeps `/compact` from burning your Opus budget.
2. **Latency.** Claude Haiku 4.5 hits ~150 tok/s with a hard 8k output cap, so compaction completes predictably (~30s for a long transcript).
3. **Cleanliness.** The compaction spawn skips MCP servers, the tool proxy, and the multi-step continuation hint. It's a one-shot text-out call; the rest is overhead.

The transcript itself is serialized rich: tool inputs and tool results are both included (each clipped at 10k chars), with oldest entries dropped first when the aggregate exceeds 180k chars. The summarizer sees actual tool activity rather than placeholders.

### Picking a different compaction model

Anything Claude Code's `--model` accepts works as a value.

---

## Extended thinking

The plugin forwards Claude's thinking blocks (`thinking_delta` stream events) to opencode as reasoning parts, so the "Thinking" row in the chat panel shows whenever the model uses extended thinking. This works across every Claude 4 family model the CLI supports.

What you see is a **summary** of the model's thinking, not the raw chain-of-thought. Anthropic [stopped exposing raw thinking on the Claude 4 family](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#summarized-thinking) and ships a server-generated digest instead. For Claude Opus 4.7 specifically, [thinking content is omitted from responses by default](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/whats-new-claude-4-7#thinking-content-omitted-by-default); the plugin opts back in by passing `--thinking-display summarized` on every spawn. Claude Code CLI 2.1.142+ is required for that flag to take effect; older CLIs skip it silently.

### Reasoning effort

Each model exposes `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max` variants, and an agent can set `reasoningEffort` in its own frontmatter (`minimal` is also accepted and maps to the CLI's `low`). The plugin hands the level to the CLI as `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` at spawn, which Claude Code treats as the session-wide override: it beats the `effortLevel` in that account's `settings.json` and a shell export of the same variable. Effort is fixed for the life of a `claude` process, so it is part of the session key. Changing effort retires the previous effort's process and remembered transcript ID before replaying the conversation into a fresh process. Switching back cannot resume stale context; same-effort streaming turns still reuse their process. This reset is scoped to the same directory, model, provider/account, agent, and conversation. If the previous effort still has pending work (including tool results, plan approval, recovery, or `/btw`), the switch is rejected: finish that work at its original effort first. Title, compaction, and `/btw` calls do not trigger effort resets.

Earlier versions injected a thinking keyword such as `(ultrathink)` into the user message instead. Claude Code stopped recognising every keyword except `ultrathink`, so that path is gone and nothing is appended to your messages any more. Compaction skips request and agent effort overrides, but still inherits a shell-level `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` when set.

### Env-var overrides

The plugin respects the standard Claude Code thinking env vars. If you set them in your shell, they pass through to the spawned process untouched, with the one exception in the first row.

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL=<level>` | Session effort override. Passes through when no effort was requested; a variant or an agent's `reasoningEffort` replaces it for that spawn. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_THINKING=1` | Disable thinking entirely. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1` | Disable adaptive thinking only. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SHOW_THINKING_SUMMARIES=0` | Suppress summaries (the plugin sets this to `1` by default when unset). |

## Quirks worth knowing

- **Empty text blocks are dropped.** Claude sometimes opens a `content_block_start` for text but never sends a delta. The plugin no longer emits the empty block (which was triggering Anthropic 400s like `cache_control cannot be set for empty text blocks`).
- **Smart incomplete-turn continuation.** By default, the plugin keeps the current opencode stream open and feeds Claude CLI a small internal continuation message when Claude emits a `result` after reasoning/tool activity without a useful visible answer. It still stops normally on final-looking answers, questions, blockers, errors, aborts, or internal safety-budget exhaustion. It also resumes an answer the model was cut off mid-sentence: a `max_tokens` stop means truncation rather than completion, so the turn continues instead of ending on half a sentence, capped at 8 attempts and 10 minutes. Every other stop reason is taken at face value. Disable with `"autoContinueIncompleteTurns": false`.
- **`AskUserQuestion`** from the CLI is converted into plain text content rather than forwarded as a tool call — unless `"Question"` is in `proxyTools`, in which case it is routed through opencode's native `question` tool (see [AskUserQuestion](#askuserquestion)).
- **Wire-inactivity watchdog.** Once the CLI has produced any content, the stream closes gracefully if stdout goes silent for 60 seconds without a `result` message arriving. Resets on every line received, so long mid-turn pauses (Sonnet between text-end and the next tool_use, for example) are tolerated. On a user-initiated abort, the watchdog shortens to 5 seconds.
- **Per-iteration usage.** When the CLI internally retries with tools, the plugin only counts the last iteration's usage so opencode's context accounting stays accurate.
- **Lazy `cwd`.** The working directory is re-resolved at every request, so opencode's project-aware behavior works without restarting the plugin.
- **Variants survive merge.** opencode recalculates variant lists after the plugin loads; the plugin re-injects defaults into runtime config so your variants don't disappear.

## Logging

Configure via `opencode.jsonc` (launch-method-independent) or env vars
(temporary override for a single process). The plugin has four orthogonal
knobs:

| Field | Values | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | `true \| false` | `false` | Persist log entries to disk |
| `dir` | path string | `~/.local/share/opencode-claude-code/` | Custom file location |
| `mode` | `"silent" \| "debug"` | `"silent"` | TUI policy |
| `level` | `"debug" \| "info" \| "notice" \| "warn" \| "error"` | `"info"` | Minimum level to emit |

Rails-style threshold: anything below `level` is dropped before either
destination decides what to do. `mode: "silent"` routes DEBUG/INFO/NOTICE
to file only and lets WARN/ERROR bubble in the TUI (they always do).
`mode: "debug"` additionally echoes every emitted level to the TUI (which
opencode surfaces as warning bubbles).

**Recommended dev setup** — capture audit trail to disk, keep TUI quiet:

```jsonc
"@khalilgharbaoui/opencode-claude-code-plugin": {
  "logging": { "file": true }
}
```

**Full firehose for deep debugging** (every DEBUG stream event captured):

```jsonc
"logging": { "file": true, "level": "debug" }
```

**Live TUI noise** (everything echoes to opencode's stderr → warning bubbles):

```jsonc
"logging": { "file": true, "mode": "debug" }
```

### Env-var overrides

Set explicitly to override config for one process — useful for one-off
debugging without editing `opencode.jsonc`:

```bash
OPENCODE_CLAUDE_CODE_LOG_FILE=1 opencode          # file on
OPENCODE_CLAUDE_CODE_LOG_FILE=0 opencode          # file off (overrides config:true)
OPENCODE_CLAUDE_CODE_LOG_DIR=/tmp/cc opencode     # custom dir
OPENCODE_CLAUDE_CODE_LOG_LEVEL=debug opencode     # capture every level
DEBUG=opencode-claude-code opencode               # promote to mode:"debug"
```

Boolean env vars accept `1/true/on/yes` for on and `0/false/no/off` for
off; empty / unset falls through to config. Invalid `level` values fall
through to config.

### Startup diagnostics

Once per process, right after the provider(s) register, the plugin logs a
single `NOTICE: claude-code plugin ready` line summarizing everything worth
knowing before you start debugging anything else:

```bash
OPENCODE_CLAUDE_CODE_LOG_FILE=1 opencode
grep "plugin ready" ~/.local/share/opencode-claude-code/plugin.log
```

```json
{
  "plugin": "0.11.1",
  "opencode": "1.18.5",
  "cwd": { "resolved": "/Users/you/code/app", "source": "process" },
  "providers": ["claude-code-default", "claude-code-work"],
  "accounts": ["default", "work"],
  "proxyTools": ["Bash", "Edit", "Write", "WebFetch", "Task"],
  "mcpServers": ["github", "slack"],
  "interactiveTransport": false,
  "anthropicApiKeyInEnv": false,
  "claudeCli": { "path": "claude", "version": "2.1.211 (Claude Code)" }
}
```

Reading it:

- **`cwd.source`** is which rule picked the working directory Claude will be
  spawned in — `configured` (you pinned `options.cwd`), `process` (normal),
  `captured` (`process.cwd()` was unusable and opencode's project directory
  rescued it, the macOS GUI-launch case), or `unresolved` (neither worked).
- **`claudeCli.version`** reading `not detected` means the `claude` binary at
  that path didn't answer `--version`, which also disables version-gated
  flags like `--thinking-display`.
- **`mcpServers`** is the on-disk merge, before opencode's runtime toggles
  are applied (those aren't settled yet at startup).
- **`opencode`** is read from the running opencode binary (`--version`), since
  opencode still does not hand its version to plugins. It reads `unknown` when
  opencode is run from source rather than as the packaged binary.

### Default behavior (no config, no env)

Nothing persists; only WARN and ERROR bubble in the TUI. The plugin
doesn't accrete a log file on every user's disk by default — opt in when
you need to inspect auto-continue decisions, broker state, or other
plugin internals.

## Compatibility with other opencode plugins

### [opencode-dcp](https://github.com/Opencode-DCP/opencode-dynamic-context-pruning) (Dynamic Context Pruning)

Partial support since v0.5.1. DCP runs in a useful degraded mode: automatic strategies and slash commands work, autonomous model-driven compression does not.

| DCP feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `experimental.chat.messages.transform` (compression placeholders, dedup, error purge) | ✅ Works | Transforms run inside opencode before reaching this plugin. |
| `experimental.chat.system.transform` (context-limit nudges, iteration reminders) | ✅ Works in headless | Headless spawns forward system-role content via `--append-system-prompt-file`. Interactive mode intentionally omits opencode's forwarded system prompt and keeps only this plugin's CLI/AGENTS/continuation prompt. |
| `/dcp compress`, `/dcp sweep`, `/dcp manual`, `/dcp context`, `/dcp stats` slash commands | ✅ Works | Handled by opencode's `command.execute.before` hook, not the model. |
| Automatic `deduplication` + `purgeErrors` strategies | ✅ Works | Message-transform only, no model tool calls. |
| Autonomous model-driven `compress` tool calls | ❌ Not supported | DCP registers `compress` as an opencode-native tool. Claude CLI only sees its own built-ins and MCP-bridged servers, so the model never sees `compress`. The plugin prepends a runtime note instructing Claude to ignore any system instruction that asks it to call `compress`/`distill`/`prune`. |

Workaround for autonomous compression: trigger it manually with `/dcp compress` whenever you'd want the model to call it. Full autonomous support would require exposing `compress` as an MCP-bridged tool, which is upstream of this plugin.

## Known limitations

- No streaming of tool inputs as they're being constructed (Anthropic's `input_json_delta`); the plugin emits them once complete.
- Raw chain-of-thought is not available. Claude 4 family models ship summarized thinking only. See [Extended thinking](#extended-thinking) for the full picture.
- Recommended Claude Code CLI: **2.1.142+**. Older CLIs work for everything else but skip the `--thinking-display` flag, so Claude Opus 4.7 turns may render empty Thinking rows. If something breaks after a Claude Code update, the CLI version is the first thing to check.
- **Foreground Task calls have a 60-minute proxy deadline** (configurable via [`proxyToolTimeoutMs`](#per-tool-proxy-timeouts)). A ceiling covering the longest configured deadline is written into Claude's generated HTTP MCP configuration so long-running opencode subagents are not cut off by Claude's 60-second default. For independent longer work, use `background: true` after enabling opencode's experimental background-subagent flag.
- **Subagent todos require explicit permission.** See [Subagent todos](#subagent-todos) for the rule and a working config.

## Publishing (maintainers)

```bash
npm version patch   # or minor/major — bumps package.json + creates the tag
git push origin master --follow-tags
```

The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs `npm publish --access public` on tag push (requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret in the repo settings — use a classic automation token so 2FA isn't required at workflow time).
