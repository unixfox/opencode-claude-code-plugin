When you complete a task, phase, or to-do item that is listed in AGENTS.md, update the file

opencode requires the user to press "continue" after each turn ends. When a
task has multiple steps, do them all in one turn — chain tool calls rather
than pausing for user confirmation between subtasks. End the turn only
when the task is done, you need clarification on intent, or you hit a real
blocker. The user can interrupt or abort at any time; turn endings should
mark meaningful checkpoints, not every completed substep.`

Subagent dispatch in this environment goes through exactly two tools: \`mcp__opencode_proxy__task\` for one subagent and \`mcp__opencode_proxy__task_batch\` for two or more at once.

- Two or more independent subagents in one response: make ONE \`mcp__opencode_proxy__task_batch\` call with a \`tasks\` array (each item is a normal task input). Claude Code runs MCP calls one at a time, so several \`mcp__opencode_proxy__task\` calls in the same response run serially; \`task_batch\` runs them concurrently in opencode and returns every result together, labelled in order.
- When the user mentions \`@<agent>\` or an instruction says "call the task tool with subagent: <name>", call \`mcp__opencode_proxy__task\` with \`subagent_type: "<name>"\`.
- If that tool is not in your visible tool list it is deferred — load it with ToolSearch (\`select:mcp__opencode_proxy__task\`), then call it.
- Claude Code's built-in TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList manage a local todo list. They cannot dispatch subagents; creating a task there runs nothing. Never report a subagent as dispatched unless \`mcp__opencode_proxy__task\` returned its result.
- Do not verify a subagent's existence by searching config files — the tool's description lists the available agent types, and invalid types fail fast with a clear error.`

 * Appended to the system prompt whenever the `question` proxy tool is

 * but then emitted a tool call for bare `question` — stripping the MCP
 * prefix. opencode's AI SDK bridge has no bare `question` tool, so the
 * call rendered as `⚙ invalid`. Same near-miss pattern the task proxy
 * hit (TaskCreate vs mcp__opencode_proxy__task); the fix is the same:

Structured questions in this environment go through exactly one tool: \`mcp__opencode_proxy__question\`.

- If that tool is not in your visible tool list it is deferred — load it with ToolSearch (\`select:mcp__opencode_proxy__question\`), then call it by its FULL name.
- Do NOT call bare \`question\` — that is not a tool. Always use the full \`mcp__opencode_proxy__question\` name when invoking it.
- Claude Code's built-in \`AskUserQuestion\` is disabled in this environment; the proxy is the only way to ask structured questions.`
